Issues with the API:

* /gdc/project is not navigatable

/gdc/project/<project_id> hierarchy exists, but there are no links
reachable from root that would point into it. On the other hand,
/gdc/md returns navigatable list of projects and is linked from
/gdc/projects as well. This list of project should probably be moved from
/gdc/md to /gdc/projects.

* Some error responses (notably token failures) don't respect Accept

They always return HTML responses, since Apache's auth modules are too
high in the processing stack. Nothing could probably be done about this.

* Certain errors return different structures than others

Some are { error => { message => ..., parameters => [...] }}, while others
lack the error key:

'{"parameters":[],"component":"Account::Login::AuthShare",
        "message":"Bad Login or Password\\"!"}',

* No charset information

Content-Encoding header is not present, nor is MIME type in Content-Type
(or multipart parts) enriched with charset= key.

* DELETE /gdc/md/<project_id> returns 200

And same contant as GET of the resource.

* 401 Error message without login makes little sense

When requesting authenticated resource without SST, only "/gdc/account/login"
message is gotten.

* Report without reportdefinitions was seen in real life

URI: /gdc/md/i729zexwpdr03c4hjf1vktrlwa5m590q/obj/7610
When POSTed to xtab2 executor3: 500 Internal Server Error
Missing ReportID in Storage.pm-&gt;Register() at /opt/common/lib/XTabLib/Storage.pm line 191.

* Inconsitency in "self" links

{report}{meta}{uri}
{project}{meta}{self}

* Crappy diagnostics from chart exporter

Exporter worker returned ERROR status at lib/WWW/GoodData/Agent.pm line 146.
This happened once without a good reason and retry succeeded.

* Invalid structure errors are really hard to grok

Checking 'result_req', result STRUCTURE INVALID - name of structure:'ResultReq'(tag:result_req),  /result_req/ExecuteResult/format: Object  does not match any alternative. Alternatives tried : [STRUCTURE INVALID - name of structure:'ResultReq'(tag:result_req),  /result_req/ExecuteResult/format/case:: Constant 'pdf' expected. at /opt/common/lib/REST/GrammarStructure/Atom.pm line 67.

] at /opt/common/lib/REST/GrammarStructure/Alternative.pm line 116.

* Chart PDF exports have weird title

One from result used should be there instead.

* Nearly all 405 responses lack Allow headers

Plain violation of 2616.

* MAQL can not be 0 characters

Such as empty UpdateMaql from GoodData-CL.

* ;s are insterted into MAQL on line breaks

Renders MAQL "#\n" invalid:
Detected invalid maql statement(s): got ';' at {"line":2,"column":1}, but ['' | 'IDENTIFIER' | 'SYNCHRONIZE' | 'DROP' | 'DEFINE' | 'OBJECT' | 'ALTER' | 'INCLUDE' | 'CREATE' | 'SELECT'] is expected. at lib/WWW/GoodData/Agent.pm line 144.

* https://secure-di.gooddata.com/gdc/uploads/nonexistent

Returns same as https://secure-di.gooddata.com/gdc/uploads instead of 404

* /gdc/account/domains/ is not navigatable
