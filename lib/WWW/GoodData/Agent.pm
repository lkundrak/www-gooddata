=head1 NAME

WWW::GoodData::Agent - HTTP client for GoodData JSON-based API

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use WWW::GoodData::Agent;
  my $ua = new WWW::GoodData::Agent;
  my $metadata = $ua->get ('/md');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<WWW::GoodData::Agent> is HTTP user agent that makes it easy for follow
specifics of the GoodData service API, transparently handles conversion
to and from JSON content type and recognizes and handles various kinds
of exceptions and error states.

It is a subclass of L<LWP::UserAgent> and follows its semantics unless
documented otherwise.

=head1 PROPERTIES

=over 4

=item root

L<URI> object pointing to root of the service API.

This is used to resolve relative request paths.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new ROOT, PARAMS

Creates a new agent instance. First argument is root of
the service API, the rest is passed to L<LWP::UserAgent> as is.

Compared to stock L<LWP::UserAgent>, it has a memory-backed
cookie storage and sets the B<Accept> header to prefer JSON content.

=cut

sub new
{
	my ($self, $root, @args) = @_;
	$self = $self->SUPER::new (@args);
	$self->{root} = $root;
	$self->agent ("perl-WWW-GoodData/$VERSION ");
	# Not backed by a file yet
	$self->cookie_jar ({});
	# Prefer JSON, but deal with whatever else comes in, instead of letting backend return 406s
	$self->default_header (Accept =>
		'application/json;q=0.9, text/plain;q=0.2, */*;q=0.1');
	return $self;
}

=item post URI, BODY, PARAMS

Constructs and issues a POST request.

Compared to stock L<LWP::UserAgent>, the extra body parameter
is encoded into JSON and set as request content, which is the
only way to set the request content.

The rest of parameters are passed to L<LWP::UserAgent> untouched.

=cut

sub post
{
	my ($self, $uri, $body, @args) = @_;
	push @args,'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
		Content => encode_json ($body);
	return $self->SUPER::post ($uri, @args);
}

=item put URI, BODY, PARAMS

Constructs and issues a PUT request.

Compared to stock L<LWP::UserAgent>, the extra body parameter
is encoded into JSON and set as request content, which is the
only way to set the request content.

The rest of parameters are passed to L<LWP::UserAgent> untouched.

=cut

sub put
{
	my ($self, $uri, $body, @args) = @_;
	push @args,'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
		Content => encode_json ($body);
	return $self->SUPER::put ($uri, @args);
}

=item delete URI

Convenience method for constructing and issuing a DELETE request.

=cut

sub delete
{
	my ($self, $uri) = @_;
	return $self->request (new HTTP::Request (DELETE => $uri));
}

=item request PARAMS

This call is common for all request types.

While API is same as stock L<LWP::UserAgent>, relative URIs
are permitted and extra content processing is done with the response.

Namely, errors are either handled or turned into exceptions
and known content types (JSON) are decoded.

=cut

sub request
{
	my ($self, $request, @args) = @_;

	# URI relative to root
	$request->uri ($request->uri->abs ($self->{root}));

	# Issue the request
	my $response = $self->SUPER::request ($request, @args);

	# Pass processed response from subrequest (redirect)
	return $response if ref $response eq 'HASH';

	# Do not bother checking content and type if there's none
	return undef if $response->code == 204;

	# Decode
	my $decoded = eval { decode_json ($response->content) }
		if $response->header ('Content-Type') =~ /^application\/json(;.*)?/;
	$decoded = {
		type => $response->header ('Content-Type'),
		raw => $response->content,
	} unless $decoded;

	# Error handling
	unless ($response->is_success) {
		# Apache::Error exceptions lack error wrapper
		$decoded = $decoded->{error} if exists $decoded->{error};
		my $request_id = $response->header ('X-GDC-Request') || "";
		$request_id = " (Request ID: $request_id)" if $request_id;
		die $response->status_line.$request_id unless exists $decoded->{message};
		die sprintf ($decoded->{message}, @{$decoded->{parameters}}).$request_id;
	}

	return $decoded;
}
